This is a 2d game engine written in ES6 with Babelify and D3js.

# Usage
This is meant to be included as a node module and not used separately. For a
usage example, see: https://github.com/brandonheyer/flocking.

# Examples
To compile the examples, run `grunt browserify`. If yo want to modify the
examples to play around, you only need to run `grunt browserify:examples` if
you do not make any changes to the core 2d-engine codebase.
